    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);// both the same.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; // this will change the last item in players and team as it is by reference
    console.log(players, team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();// using slice with no argument will only make a copy of the original array
    team2[4] = 'yes mate';
    console.log(players, team2);

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // concat original array in an empty arry will creat a copy of the original.
    team3[4] = 'yooooo';
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 =[...players];
    team4[4] = 'jordan';
    console.log(players, team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[4] = 'james';
    console.log(players, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'tom salah',
        age: 80
    };

    console.log(person);

    // and think we make a copy:
        const captain = person;
        captain.number = 99;
        console.log(person, captain); // this will add number to person and captain

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    var captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { newNumber : 2017, age: 35});
    console.log(person, captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}; not available yert

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
